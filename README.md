# ADIF Multitool

Validate, modify, and convert ham radio log files with a handy command-line
tool. üìªüå≥ü™ì

`adifmt` provides a suite of commands for working with
[ADIF](https://adif.org/) logs from ham radio software.  It is run from a
shell, via [Terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_(macOS)) on macOS
and [PowerShell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerShell),
[cmd.exe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cmd.exe), or
[Windows Terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Terminal)  on Windows.
Each `adifmt` invocation reads log files from the command line or standard
input and prints an ADIF log to standard output, allowing multiple commands to
be chained together in a pipeline.  For example, to add a `BAND` field based on
the `FREQ` (radio frequency) field, add your station's maidenhead locator
(`MY_GRIDSQURE`) to all entries, automatically fix some incorrectly formatted
fields, validate that all fields are properly formatted, and save a log file
containing only SSB voice contacts, a pipeline might look like

```sh
adifmt infer --fields band my_original_log.adi \
  | adifmt edit --add my_gridsquare=FN31pr \
  | adifmt fix \
  | adifmt validate \
  | adifmt filter --field mode=SSB \
  | adifmt save my_ssb_log.adx
```

*(The `filter` command is not yet implemented.)*

On Windows, PowerShell uses the backtick character (`` ` ``) and Command Prompt
uses caret (`^`)  instead of backslash (`\`) for multi-line pipelines.  You
can also put the whole pipeline on a single line; they are presented as
multiple lines here for readability.

*Note*: `adifmt` is pronounced ‚ÄúADIF M T‚Äù or ‚ÄúADIF multitool‚Äù, not ‚Äúadi fmt‚Äù nor
‚Äùaddy format‚Äù.

## Quick start

ADIF Multitool is not yet available as a binary distribution, so you will need
a Go compiler on your system (version at least 1.18).  To check, run
`go version` at the command line.  If the `go` program is not found,
[download and install it](https://go.dev/dl/).  Then run
`go install github.com/flwyd/adif-multitool/adifmt@latest` to make the `adifmt`
command available.  (You may need to add the `$GOBIN` environment variable to
your path.)  To see if it works, run `adifmt help`.  If the command is not
found, try `go run github.com/flwyd/adif-multitool/adifmt help`

To do something useful with ADIF Multitool, the syntax is

```
adifmt command [options] files...
```

For example, the `cat` command concatenates all input files and outputs ADIF
data to standard output:

```sh
adifmt cat log1.adi log2.adi > combined.adi
```

prints all of the records in the two `logX.adi` files to the `combined.adi`
file.

Flags control input and output options.  For example, to print records with
a UNIX newline between fields, two newlines between records, use lower case for
all field names, and user defined fields `gain_db` (range ¬±100) and
`radio_color` (values black, white, or gray):

```sh
adifmt cat --adi-field-separator=newline \
  --adi-record-separator=2newline \
  --adi-lower-case \
  --userdef='GAIN_DB,{-100:100}' \
  --userdef='radio_color,{black,white,gray' \
  log1.csv
```

Multiple input and output formats are supported (currently ADI and ADX per the
ADIF spec, CSV with field names matching the ADIF list, and JSON with a similar
format to ADX).

```sh
adifmt cat --input=adi --output=csv log1.adi > log1.csv
adifmt cat --input=csv --output=adi log2.csv > log2.adi
```

`--input` need not be specified if it‚Äôs implied by the file name or can be
inferred from the structure of the data.  `--ouput=adi` is the default for
output format.  `adifmt save` infers the output format from the file‚Äôs
extension.  Input files can be in different formats:

```sh
adifmt cat log1.adi log2.adx log3.csv log4.json log5.tsv > combined.adi
```

If no file names are given, input is read from standard input:

```
gunzip --stdout mylog.csv.gz | adifmt cat --output=adx | gzip > mylog.adx.gz
```

This is useful in composing several `adifmt` invocations together.  Commands
can be combined in a Unix-style pipeline.  The `fix` command automatically
changes some values to match the expected ADIF format such as changing a time
field from `12:34:56` to `123456` and a date from `2012-03-04` to `20120304`.
The `select` command prints only a subset of fields.  The `save` command writes
the input data to a file.  These can be combined:

```sh
adifmt fix log1.adi \
  | adifmt select --fields qso_date,time_on,call \
  | adifmt save minimal.csv
```

creates a file named `minimal.csv` with just the date, time, and callsign from
each record in the input file `log1.adi`.

## Features

### Input/Output formats

`adifmt` can read from and write to the following formats.  ADI (tag-based) and
ADX (XML-based) formats are [specified by ADIF](https://adif.org.uk/adiif).
Others use standard formats for arbitrary key-value data.  Format-specific
options are configured with option flags.  Formats are inferred from file names
or can be set explicitly via `--input` and `--output` options.

Name  | Extension | Notes
----- | --------- | -----
ADI   | `.adi`    | Outputs `IntlString` (Unicode fields) in UTF-8
ADX   | `.adx`    |
CSV   | `.csv`    | Comma-separated values; other delimiters supported via the `--csv-field-separator` option
JSON  | `.json`   | Can parse number and boolean typed data, to write these set the `--json-typed-output` option
TSV   | `.tsv`    | Tab-separated values, tabs and line breaks escaped if `--tsv-escape-special` is set

Input files can have fields with any names, even if they‚Äôre not part of the
ADIF spec.  The `--userdef` option will add user-defined field metadata to ADI
and ADX output specifying type, range, or valid enumeration values.  ADX XML
tags must be upper case; other formats accept any case field names in input
files and use `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for output by default.  Application-defined
fields in CSV, TSV, and JSON should use the `APP_PROGRAMNAME_FIELD_NAME` syntax
used in ADI files. JSON input files should be structured as follows; `HEADER` is
optional.

```json
{
 "HEADER": {
  "ADIF_VER": "3.1.4",
  "more": "header fields"
 },
 "RECORDS": [
  {
   "CALL": "W1AW",
   "more_fields": "record fields"
  },
  {
   "CALL": "NA1SS",
   "more_fields": "additional record fields"
  }
 ]
}
```

Some (but not all) comments found in ADI and ADX files are preserved from input
to output.  Details of comment handling are subject to change and should not be
depended upon.

#### International text and Unicode

`adifmt` currently assumes all input files are encoded in
[UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8), which includes ASCII-only files.

For backwards-compatibility with ASCII-only software, the
[ADIF specification](https://adif.org.uk/314/ADIF_314.htm#Data_Types_Enumerations_and_Fields)
defines `Character` and `String` types as
[ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII)-only, with `IntlCharacter` and
`IntlString` as allowing any Unicode character (except line breaks unless in a
`IntlMultilineString` field).  Additionally, as of ADIF version 3.1.4, ADI
files are supposed to be ASCII-only and may not have `Intl*` fields.  ADIF
Multitool deviates from the spec by passing through Intl fields in ADI files
and writing Unicode characters in UTF-8.  (This allows ADI to be the default
output format in a pipeline of several commands, then save to a format which
allows Unicode.)  Unicode characters can be rejected in ADI files with the
`--adi-ascii-only` option, though if used with
`adifmt save --overwrite-existing` the file may be deleted before the program
aborts with an error; this will still output Intl fields if they contain only
ASCII characters.  `adifmt validate` ensures that ‚Äúnon-intl‚Äù fields are
ASCII-only; other commands pass through Unicode strings untouched.

### Commands

ADIF Multitool behavior is organized into _commands_; each `adifmt` invocation
runs one command.  Commands are the first program argument, before any options
or file names: `adifmt command --some-option --other=value file1.adi file2.csv`

Name       | Description |
---------- | ----------- |
`cat`      | Concatenate all input files to standard output |
`edit`     | Add, change, remove, or adjust field values |
`fix`      | Correct field formats to match the ADIF specification |
`help`     | Print program or command usage information |
`infer`    | Add missing fields based on present fields |
`save`     | Save standard input to file with format inferred by extension |
`select`   | Print only specific fields from the input |
`validate` | Validate field values; non-zero exit and no stdout if invalid |
`version`  | Print program version information |

`adifmt help` will also show this list.

#### help

`adifmt help` prints usage information, a list of available commands, and
options which apply to any command.  `adifmt help cmd` prints usage information
about and options for command `cmd`.  There are a lot of options, so consider
running `adifmt help | less`.

#### cat

`adifmt cat` reads all input records and prints them to standard output.  Given
several input files (perhaps one per day, callsign, or location) `cat` will
combine them into a single file.  `cat` can also be used to convert from one
format to another, e.g. `adifmt cat --output=csv mylog.adi` to convert from ADI
format to CSV.  (If `--input` is not specified the file type is inferred from
the file name; if `--output` is not specified ADI is used.)

#### edit

`adifmt edit` adds, changes, or removes fields in each input record.
Options can be specified multiple times, e.g.
`adifmt edit --add my_gridsquare=FN31pr --add "my_name=Hiram Percy Maxim" log.adi`

The `--set` option (`name=value`) changes the value of the given field on all
records, adding it if it is not present.  The `--add` option (`name=value`)
only adds the field if it is not already present in the record.  The `--remove`
option (field names, optionally comma-separated) deletes the field from all
records.  The `--remove-blank` removes all blank fields (string representation
is empty).

The `--time-zone-from` and `--time-zone-to` options will shift the `TIME_ON` and
`TIME_OFF` fields (along with `QSO_DATE` and `QSO_DATE_OFF` if applicable) from
one time zone to another, defaulting to UTC.  For example, if you have a CSV
file with contact times in your local QTH in New South Wales you can convert it
to UTC (Zulu time) with `adifmt edit --time-zone-from Australia/Sydney file.csv`.

#### fix

`adifmt fix` coerces some fields into the format dictated by the ADIF
specification.  The rule of thumb for default fixes is that they should be
unsurprising to almost anyone, like converting `3:45 PM` to `1545` for a time
field.  Currently only date, time, and location fields are coerced.  Dates must
already be in year, month, day order.  Location fields can be converted from
decimal (GPS) coordinates to degrees/minutes.

`fix` also changes [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 and alpha-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1)
codes in the `COUNTRY` and `MY_COUNTRY` to
[DXCC entity names](https://adif.org.uk/314/ADIF_314.htm#DXCC_Entity_Code_Enumeration)
if a match is found.  This can save a lot of typing for `BA` -> `BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA`
or `USA` ‚Üí `UNITED STATES OF AMERICA`  Note that some DXCC entities like
Alaska, Hawaii, Crete, Corsica, Sardinia, many other remote islands, and
international organizations do not have ISO 3166 codes.  A few countries do not
have a single DXCC entity for ‚Äúthe mainland‚Äù, including the United Kingdom
(separated into England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland), Russia
(European Russia, Asiatic Russia, and Kaliningrad), Kiribati (separated into
island chains), and a few dependent island territories.  Country code
translations will not be applied for those since it‚Äôs not obvious which DXCC
entity was contacted.

In the future, other formats may be fixable, including varieties of the Boolean
data types, forcing some string fields to upper case, and perhaps correcting
some other common variations on enum fields as is done with countries.  A
future update will also provide options like date formats so that
day/month/year or month/day/year input data can be unambiguously fixed.

#### infer

`adifmt infer` guesses the value for fields which are not present in a record.
Field names to infer are given by the `-fields` option, which can be repeated
multiple times and/or comma-separated.  Fields in the list will not be changed
if they are present in a record with a non-empty value.

`SIG_INFO` and `MY_SIG_INFO` are handled specially.  If `SIG`/`MY_SIG` is is
present, that value determines which field to use for `SIG_INFO`/`MY_SIG_INFO`.
For example, if `SIG` is `SOTA`, `SIG_INFO` will be set to the value of
`SOTA_REF` even if `POTA_REF` is also present.  If `SIG`/`MY_SIG` is absent,
all special activity fields (IOTA, POTA, SOTA, WWFF) will be checked.  If
exactly one of them is present, that value will be used for
`SIG_INFO`/`MY_SIG_INFO` and `SIG`/`MY_SIG` will be set to the activity name.
If (`MY_`)`SIG` is set to a special interest activity or event that does not
have a dedicated ADIF field (e.g. 13 Colonies, Volunteers on the Air),
(`MY_`)`SIG_INFO` will not be inferred.

Inferable fields:

* `BAND` from `FREQ`
* `BAND_RX` from `FREQ_RX`
* `MODE` from `SUBMODE`
* `COUNTRY` from `DXCC`
* `MY_COUNTRY` from `MY_DXCC`
* `DXCC` from `COUNTRY`
* `MY_DXCC` from `MY_COUNTRY`
* `GRIDSQUARE` and `GRIDSQUARE_EXT` from `LAT`/`LON`
* `MY_GRIDSQUARE` and `MY_GRIDSQUARE_EXT` from `MY_LAT`/`MY_LON`
* `OPERATOR` from `GUEST_OP`
* `STATION_CALLSIGN` from `OPERATOR` or `GUEST_OP`
* `OWNER_CALLSIGN` from `STATION_CALLSIGN`, `OPERATOR`, or `GUEST_OP`
* `SIG_INFO` from one of `IOTA`, `POTA_REF`, `SOTA_REF`, or `WWFF_REF` based on
  `SIG` (sets `SIG` if unset and only one of the others is set)
* `MY_SIG_INFO` from one of `MY_IOTA`, `MY_POTA_REF`, `MY_SOTA_REF`, or
  `MY_WWFF_REF` based on `MY_SIG` (sets `MY_SIG` if unset and only one of the
  others is set)
* `IOTA`, `POTA_REF`, `SOTA_REF`, and `WWFF_REF` from `SIG_INFO` if `SIG` is
  set to the appropriate program.
* `MY_IOTA`, `MY_POTA_REF`, `MY_SOTA_REF`, and `MY_WWFF_REF` from `MY_SIG_INFO`
  if `MY_SIG` is set to the appropriate program.

#### save

`adifmt save` writes ADIF records from standard input to a file.  The output
format is inferred from the file name or can be given explicitly with
`--output`.  Existing files will not be overwritten unless the
`--overwrite-existing` option is given.  The output file will not be written
(and will exit with a non-zero code) if there are no records in the input; this
allows a chain like `adifmt fix log.adi | adifmt validate | adifmt save
--overwrite-existing log.adi` which will attempt to fix any errors in `log.adi`
and save back to the same file, but which won‚Äôt clobber it if validation still
fails.  Writing a zero-record file can be forced with `--write-if-empty`.

#### select

`adifmt select` outputs only the specified fields.  Currently each field must
be specified by name, either in a comma-separated list or by specifying the
`--field` option multiple times.  The following uses are equivalent:

```sh
adifmt select --fields call,qso_date,time_on,time_off mylog.adi
adifmt select --fields call --fields qso_date --fields time_on,time_off mylog.adi
```

`select` can be effectively combined with other standard Unix utilities.  To
find duplicate QSOs by date, band, and mode, use
[sort](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/sort.1.html) and
[uniq](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/uniq.1.html):

```sh
adifmt select --fields call,qso_date,band,mode --output csv mylog.adi \
  | tail +2 | sort | uniq -d
```

This is similar to a SQL `SELECT` clause, except it cannot (yet?) transform the
values it selects.

#### validate

`adifmt validate` checks that field values match the format and enumeration
values in [the ADIF specification](https://adif.org.uk/adif).  Errors and
warnings are printed to standard error.  If any field has an error, nothing is
printed to standard output and exit status is `0`; if no errors are present (or
only warnings), the input will be printed to standard output as in
[`cat`](#cat) and exit status is `1`.  If the output format is ADI or ADX,
warnings will be included as record-level comments in the output.

Validations include field type syntax (e.g. number and date formats);
enumeration values (e.g. modes and bands), and number ranges.  The ADIF
specification allows some fields to have values which do not match the
enumerated options, for example the `SUBMODE` field says ‚Äúuse enumeration values
for interoperability‚Äù but the type is string, allowing any value.  These
warnings will be printed to standard error with `adifmt validate` but will not
block the logfile from being printed to standard output.

Some but not all validation errors can be corrected with [`adifmt fix`](#fix).

#### version

`adifmt version` prints the version number of the installed program, the ADIF
specification version, and URLs to learn more.

### Future features (under construction)

ADIF Multitool was created because I was recording
[Parks on the Air](https://parksontheair.com/) logs on paper and then typing
them into a spreadsheet. I needed a way to convert exported CSV files into ADIF
format for upload to [the POTA website](https://pota.app/) while fixing
incompatibilities between the spreadsheet data format and the expected ADIF
structure.  I decided to solve this problem with a ‚ÄúSwiss Army knife for ADIF
files‚Äù following the
[Unix pipeline philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_\(Unix\)) of
simple tools that do one thing and can be easily composed together to build more
powerful expressions.

There are a lot of things that a ham radio log file program could do, and I
would like `adifmt` to do many of them. The program is nearing feature maturity
for an initial release.  If you've got a use case for working with ADIF files
that `adifmt` can‚Äôt do yet, please create a GitHub issue to discuss how it
might work.

Features I plan to add:

*   Validate more fields.
*   Filter a log to only records matching some criteria, similar to a SQL
    `WHERE` clause.
*   Identify duplicate records using flexible criteria, e.g., two contacts with
    the same callsign on the same band with the same mode on the same Zulu day
    and the same `MY_SIG_INFO` value.
*   Specify a file name template for `save` to group records by a set of fields:
    `adifmt cat all.csv | adifmt save '{MY_CALL}@{MY_POTA_REF}-{QSO_DATE}.adi'`
    to split a large log file into one log file for each (callsign, park, date)
    group, matching the expected POTA filename format.
*   Option for `save` to append records to an existing ADIF file.
*   Count the total number of records or the number of distinct values of a
    field.  (The total number of records can currently be counted with
    `--output=tsv`, piping the output to `wc -l`, and subtracting 1 for the
    header row.)  This could match the format of the ‚ÄúReport‚Äù comment in the
    test QSOs file produced with the ADIF spec.
*   Maybe convert to and from Cabrillo format for contests.  Cabrillo has header
    fields that don‚Äôt clearly map to ADIF header fields.  Fields like expected
    contest score would need per-contest configuration.

### Non-goals

I don't expect ADIF Multitool to support the following use cases. A different
piece of software will be needed.

*   Upload logs to any service like QRZ, eQSL, or LotW.
*   Log-editing GUI. `adifmt` is a command-line tool; a GUI could be built which
    uses it to make edits, but that would be a separate program and project. I
    am open to the idea of an interactive console mode, though.
*   Live logging. `adifmt` is meant for processing logs that have already been
    created, not for logging contacts as they happen over the air. There are
    many fine amateur radio logging programs, most of which can export ADIF
    files that `adifmt` can process.  You could also keep logs in a text file,
    massage it to a CSV, and then process it with `adifmt`.

## Scripting and compatibility

ADIF Multitool  is designed to be easy to include in scripts.  If you have a
workflow for dealing with ham radio logs, such as converting from CSV, adding
fields, and validating field syntax before uploading to the POTA or SOTA
websites, consider automating that process with `adifmt`.

ADIF Multitool is still ‚Äúversion zero‚Äù and the command line interface should be
considered unstable.  If you use v0 `adifmt` in a script or other program, be
prepared to update your code if commands or options change.  In particular, use
GNU-style double dashes for options (`--input`) rather than Go-style single
dashes (`-input`); the program may change to a GNU/POSIX-style flag-parsing
library which requires double dashes.

The `adif` and `cmd` packages should be considered ‚Äúless stable‚Äù than the CLI
during the v0 phase and may undergo significant change.  Use of those packages
in your own program should only be done with significant tolerance to churn.

The v1 and future releases will follow
[Semantic Versioning](https:///semver.org/) and any breaking changes to the CLI
or public Go APIs will need to wait for v2.  ADIF spec updates and new features
will lead to a new minor version and bug fixes will increment the patch number.
If you find this useful as a library, please let me know.

I have not yet tested this on Windows; please
[report issues](https://github.com/flwyd/adif-multitool/issues) if anything does
not work, or is particularly awkward.
