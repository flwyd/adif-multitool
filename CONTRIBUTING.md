# How to Contribute

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are
just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

## Follow the code of conduct

Open Source works best when everyone feels comfortable and empowered to
participate. Please read and follow the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
and don't be a jerk.

## Discuss new functionality

This project takes an opinionated approach, following the Unix pipeline
philosophy. There are many features that adif-multitool could add, but they
should be done in harmony with the tool's philosophy. For new features or
changes in behavior, please open an issue first to discuss the semantics of the
feature. For straightforward bug fixes, a pull request by itself is sufficient.
